# Future-Market-Analysis-by-Fractal-Scaling-and-Long-Term-Memory
Description:
This repository contains a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model designed to forecast future market trends. LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that has memory cells capable of capturing long-term dependencies in sequential data. By leveraging this property, our LSTM model aims to predict the future values of a given market based on its historical data. In addition, there is also code that details the calculation of Rescaled Range (R/S) and the Hurst Exponent on a sliding 30 lag window for additional fractial data for the LSTM model. 

Features:
Data Preprocessing: Includes functionality to clean, normalize, and transform market data into a suitable format for training the LSTM model.
Model Training: User-friendly interface for training the LSTM model, optimizing hyperparameters, and evaluating model performance.
Prediction & Visualization: Tools to visualize forecasted results alongside historical data and evaluate prediction accuracy.
Scalability: Can be adapted to various market data sources, from stocks to commodities, to cryptocurrency.

Requirements:
Python 3.7+
TensorFlow 2.x
NumPy
pandas
Matplotlib

Usage:
Clone the repository.
Use the preprocessing tools to prepare your market data.
Train the LSTM model using your prepared dataset.
Evaluate and visualize model predictions using the provided tools.
